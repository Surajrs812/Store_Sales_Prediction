## Introduction

Retail businesses rely on accurate sales forecasting to manage their inventory and make data-driven decisions. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting store sales.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Sales Forecasting: Predict store sales accurately to help businesses plan their operations.
2. Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to gain insights into sales trends.
3. Data Cleaning: Ensure data quality by handling missing values.
4. Model Building: Utilize Linear and Lasso Regression for sales prediction.
5. Evaluation: Assess model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
6. Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for machine learning models.

## Methodologies

The project employs the following methodologies:

- Data Analysis: Analyze numerical and categorical features in the dataset.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values for clean data.
- Model Building: Train Linear and Lasso Regression models.
- Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical data and split the dataset.
- Evaluation: Measure model accuracy with MSE and R-squared.

## Implications
